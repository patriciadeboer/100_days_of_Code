	<p> Now that I've got some of the key github stuff set up, I want to start brushing up on that css and build some formatting into the site. I want to think about the overall structure and feel of the site so I can encorporate it when I write my HTML files. It'll be harder to go back than to do them hand in hand. <br/>For now, to allow for easy navigation in the browser, I would like to be able to set up a main menu so I can maneauver through the site as needed without having to type the full URL for each entry. So plan is to attack that first.</p>

		<p>Lastly, I'm trying to build a robust folder structure and naming convention that will be easy to follow, will keep me organized and allow for growth. After doing research, some changes I'm making now before it gets too complicated are: </p>

		<ul>
			<li>Save all files with lowercase, no spaces, and alphanumberics expect _ (underscore)or -(dash)</li>
			<li>Pick something that you like, as once you commit it's hard to change it later due to all the links you inevitably build into your files / code</li>
			<li>Keep it to under 32 characters including .html / .htm extension</li>
			<li>Start each file name with a letter</li>
		</ul>
