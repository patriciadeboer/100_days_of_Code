# A website made to track my coding process as I learn to code. 

*********************************

Starting August 15, I will take the 100 Days of Code challenge. This is where I'll store my progress. Until then I will take a few online courses to get familiar with coding again. Wish me luck!

Name: Patricia de Boer

Still trying to get the hang of GitHub, but alas, practice makes perfect!

*********************************

Over the course of my coding experience, I expect the layout of this blog to change. I will take weekly snapshots of the blog to show the changes as we move through pieces. I will try to keep a journal entry for each change in the site. I may not be able to update that daily but the goal is to have some new designs daily to practice my coding and improve it on a daily basis.
