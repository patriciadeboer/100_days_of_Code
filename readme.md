# A website made to track my coding process as I learn to code. Starting July 12, I will take the 100 Days of Code challenge. This is where I'll store my progress. Until then I will take a course online to get familiar with coding again. Wish me luck!

Name: Patricia de Boer

Still trying to get the hang of GitHub, but alas, practice makes perfect!

Over the course of my coding experience, I expect the layout of this blog to change.
